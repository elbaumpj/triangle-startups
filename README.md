# Research Triangle, NC Startups

A curated list of startups in the Research Triangle of North Carolina. 

**Criteria:** Deciding what kind of business qualifies as a startup is inherently subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules for it. That said, the general idea is to include companies that fit roughly this profile:

* In Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill or the immediately surrounding area
* 100 employees or fewer
* Revenues fewer than $20M
* Fewer than 4 years in business

Pull requests are welcome. Please keep the list in alphabetical order and follow the schema as it's been laid out.
